<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>My name is Wojciech Lipski, I was born on the 29th of April 2002 making me 21 years as of today, I am a happy married man who is learning coding in hopes to make it his career and if you ask me, this is one heck of a way to show what you are made of ;) I am talking to you, the one that will hire me... you made the call right?</p>

<h2>What do I know?</h2>
<p>What do I not know? well a lot but I am getting there to gain wisdom, but I know HTML and that's more than enough if you ask me, okay well maybe not, but I will learn more and I will add more to this section so for now enjoy these three dots to mark this paragraph as unfinished! ... (ooh how mysterious)</p>

<h2>Additonal things I know?</h2>
<p>Ok I don't really like mentioning it but I did finish a 1 year nursing course and yes I can work as a nurse but I refuse, and I did get certified as a welder after completing that course too but no one would hire me due to lack of transport... and I did finish a warehousing course that made me a certified forklift driver! and I am still working as that indeed... Well that's all I know about myself for now I guess...</p>
